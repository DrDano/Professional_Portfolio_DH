## About Me

I am a developer-in-training, currently employed as an analyst at a wholesale nursery plant brokerage. I focus on writing VBA scrips to automate our workflows, but I also manage our online inventory. I am originally from Arizona, but I am loving Oregon! On my days off I like to game with friends both local and far away, and spend time with family.
